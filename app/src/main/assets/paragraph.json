    "paragraph": "A number of staple crops are today quite commonplace in much of the world and feed much of today's population.  These staple crops of today originated in different eras and in different parts of the world before spreading throughout the rest of the globe.|Wheat was probably the earliest cereal to have been grown and most likely was a hybrid of wild grasses rather than a single wild grass.  It is known to have been cultivated by Mediterranean civilizations 10,000 years ago and was being used as a primary ingredient in baked goods in Mesopotamia as early as 8000 B.C.|Beans are a diverse family of plants that have been cultivated for 8,000 years.  Certain types of beans, such as mung and soy, were first cultivated in Asia, while other types of beans, such as string and lima, are thought to have originated in the Americas.|Other crops that originated in the Americas are potatoes and maize, a relative of corn; maize was used extensively beginning around 5000 B.C. in civilizations in what is today Mexico, while the cultivation of the potato developed in civilizations in the Andes at least as early as 100 B.C.  Maize and potatoes were staples of the diets of their respective cultures long before they were introduced to Europe in the sixteenth century by European explorers who had discovered them in the Americas.|The cultivation of rice is not as old as the cultivation of wheat, beans, and maize.  Rice was first known to have been cultivated in India around 3000 B.C.  From there, it later spread to China, Japan, and various countries in Southeast Asia, which are today major producers of the crop."

    "paragraph": "Caleb Bradham, called \"Doc\" Bradham by friends and acquaintances, was the owner of a pharmacy at the end of the nineteenth century.  In his pharmacy, Doc Bradham had a soda fountain, as was customary in pharmacies of the time.  He took great pleasure in creating new and unusual mixtures of drinks for customers at the fountain.|Like many other entrepreneurs of the era, Doc Bradham wanted to create a cola drink to rival Coca-Cola.  By 1895, Coca-Cola was a commercial success throughout the United States, and numerous innovators were trying to come up with their own products to cash in on the success that Coca-Cola was beginning to experience.  In his pharmacy, Doc Bradham developed his own version of a cola drink, and Doc's drink became quite popular at his soda fountain.  The drink he created was made with a syrup consisting of sugar, essence of vanilla, cola nuts, and other flavorings.  The syrup was mixed at the soda fountain with carbonated water before it was served.|The drink that Doc Bradham created was originally called \"Brad's drink\" by those in his hometown of New Bern who visited the soda fountain and sampled his product.  Those who tasted the drink claimed not only that it had a refreshing and invigorating quality but also that it had a medicinal value by providing relief from dyspepsia, or upset stomach.  From this reputed ability to relieve dyspepsia, Doc Bradham created the name of Pepsi-Cola for his drink.  Doc Bradham eventually made the decision to mass market his product, and in 1902 he founded the Pepsi-Cola Company.  The advertising for this new product, of course, touted the drink as an \"invigorating drink\" that \"aids digestion."

    "paragraph": "Opal is a noncrystalline mineral that has been used as a gemstone in numerous cultures for thousands of years.  Quantities of high-grade opal have been mined in diverse areas worldwide, including eastern Europe, Australia, and Mexico, as well as in the states of California, Nevada, and Idaho in the United States.|Some varieties of opal contain flashes of a wide spectrum of colors, while others do not.  Those types of opal with tiny specks of iridescent color are called precious opal.  Varieties without this iridescent coloration throughout are called common opal.  It is the precious opal, with its rainbow-like assortment of colors dotting the stone that has been considered gemstone quality over the ages.  Precious opal has numerous colors that serve as a background for the iridescent specks, the most valuable of which are black, white, and blue opal, as well as the reddish-brown stone known as fire opal.|In some cultures, precious opal is recognized not only as a gemstone of great attraction but also as an omen of bad luck.  Much of the superstition surrounding opal is now believed to have arisen from the tendency of opal to dry out and crack.  Opal is a hydrated mineral with a water content that ranges from 1 percent to 21 percent.  The hardness of a particular opal depends upon its water content, which can vary and can be particularly low in dry climates.  Throughout its long history, the negative superstition surrounding opal has been related to the tendency of opal to crack seemingly spontaneously, without any noticeable justification.  A crack in an opal has been viewed as an indication that bad luck is on its way.  In reality, though, a seemingly spontaneous crack in a stone is most likely due to a loss of essential water."

    "paragraph": "Susan B. Anthony, teacher by trade and lifelong champion of women's rights, participated throughout her adulthood in the effort to improve the status of women in the United States and to gain rights for them.  She was a stalwart champion of economic independence for women, recognizing the importance of financial independence to the emancipation of women.|She worked tirelessly from 1854 to 1860 in the fight to obtain rights for married women in the state of New York.  She spoke out on the issues, organized volunteers, and circulated petitions asking that married women be granted the rights to own property, to earn wages, to have custody of their children in the event of divorce, and to vote.  In 1860, the landmark Married Women's Property Act, which conferred all of the above rights except the right to vote, was passed in the state of New York.  It became law in large part due to the efforts of Anthony.|In the years following the Civil War, Anthony dedicated her life to obtaining the right to vote for women.  She believed that the right to vote should be a federal right and should not be left up to the discretionary authority of each individual state.  Throughout the rest of her career, she worked on the national level toward the accomplishment of this goal.|Unfortunately, Anthony did not live to see her dream accomplished.  In 1900, at the age of 80, she retired from the presidency of the National American Woman Suffrage Association without having fulfilled her goal of achieving the vote for women but with the undertaking well underway.|When the vote was finally granted to women in the United States in 1920, Anthony was given credit as a primary contributor in the accomplishment of this monumental change in social structure.  In recognition of Anthony's accomplishments, the United States government issued a one-dollar coin in her honor in 1979.  The front side of the coin contained a side view of Anthony's face and was inscribed across the top with the word \"liberty.\""

    "paragraph": "The apple, a juicy fruit that grows from pink or white flowers, is cultivated widely in orchards across North America.  At least two varieties of apples are cultivated together in one orchard due to the fact that the flowers of one type of apple tree must be pollinated by a different variety of apple.  The point in the springtime when the apple blossoms appear is the most critical time for apples: there have to be enough bees to pollinate each flower and warm enough weather to facilitate their work.  Apple growers watch the temperatures anxiously at this time of year because frozen flowers or fruit spells disaster for the crop.  Workers may have to get up at any hour of the night to blow away the cold air with fans, heat the orchard air with fire pots, or wet the trees down to keep the frost away.|The first step in getting apples from orchard to market is to pick them.  The picking must be done carefully to ensure that the spur, which produces the fruit, is not damaged.  Apples used to be collected in bushel baskets and taken to market, but today bins of apples are trucked to packing houses, where they go through many sortings before they get to the grocery store display.  As a first step, the smallest apples, called \"chops,\" are eliminated to make juice.  Apples with many flaws, or imperfections, are called \"processors\"; they are used for pie slices or are made into sauce because of their less-than-perfect appearance.  The \"fancy\" grade apples are stored in a controlled atmosphere; adjusting the oxygen content from 20 percent to 2 percent and keeping the temperature between 31 and 32 degrees Fahrenheit keeps the apples alive but prevents overripening.  The humidity is kept around 95 percent so that the apples remain crisp and fresh.  Before shipping, the apples are washed, rinsed, dried, and coated with a thin film of hot wax for beautification.|Once the apples have cleared the marketplace, they are put to various uses.  Apples are 87 percent water, making them great for juicing.  The fresh juice that is made from apples is called cider, and this cider can be fermented into applejack.  Apples are not only used to make beverages; they can also be used to make products such as apple butter, vinegar, applesauce, and one of America's favorite desserts, apple pie."

    "paragraph": "An octopus is a sea creature quite capable of inspiring fear in an unsuspecting swimmer or diver unlucky enough to paddle across one unexpectedly.  There is a basis for a healthy fear of an octopus.  An octopus is quite strong, in large part due to the suckers on its arms.  A common octopus has 240 suckers per arm for a whopping total of 1,920 suckers on all of its arms.  Were an octopus to hold onto an object (or a person, for that matter) with all eight of its arms, a quarter of a ton of force would be needed to loosen its grip.  Another reason wariness for an octopus is not unwarranted is that some types of octopuses are poisonous.  A bite from a venomous type of octopus will undoubtedly cause a stinging pain and may, if left unattended, lead to death within a few hours.|While maintaining a healthy distance from an octopus may be a reasonable position, it is also quite arguable that an octopus poses little threat to humans.  An octopus is shy and timid by nature, much more comfortable hiding out in undersea nooks and crannies or burrowing into the sandy bottom than in seeking out conflict.  An octopus only strikes out when it feels threatened, when an unexpected invader enters its undersea lair or a potential attacker gets too close.  In this situation, an octopus may attack by biting or wrapping its arms around the threatening force.|An octopus, in reality, is much more concerned with avoidance than attack and has a couple of specialized methods of getting away from potential attackers.  One method is to eject forceful jets of water.  These high-powered streams of water allow an octopus to make a high-speed exit from a dangerous location.  Another technique that the octopus uses when eluding a danger is to eject a volume of dark-colored ink.  The ink temporarily clouds the water and confuses the sense of smell of the attacker while the octopus quickly flees."

    "paragraph": "Today, the Secret Service is the agency of the United States government that is charged with the protection of the president and family members of the president.  Any time that the president appears in public, neatly dressed Secret Service agents are clearly in evidence alongside the president.  Secret Service agents might also accompany a presidential spouse to a committee meeting, on a shopping trip, to a charity event, or out for a walk in the park.  Agents accompany the president's children to school on a daily basis, sitting unobtrusively but hardly unnoticed in the background throughout each hour of class, and tag along with the president's children on dates and to any type of social event.|If the Secret Service is so much in evidence around the president and members of the president's family, one might question why the activities of these agents are considered secret.  The name of the agency, however, is not derived from its duty in protecting the president but from its original covert duty in protecting the economy of the young United States from counterfeiters.  Before the Civil War, the official currency of the United States was in coins; however, after the war, the government began issuing paper money.  This new paper currency was easy for counterfeiters to replicate, and soon counterfeit bills flooded the country.  Secret Service agents, as part of the Department of the Treasury, posed as criminals interested in purchasing large sums of counterfeit bills in order to gather evidence against counterfeiters and put them out of their illegal  business.  For quite some time, the government preferred to keep the public in the dark about the extent of the counterfeiting at that time, afraid that the public would lose confidence in the country's paper money if they knew that there was so much counterfeit money mixed in with the real thing.|It was not until 1901 that the role of the Secret Service was expanded from protecting the currency of the country to protecting its president.  In that year, then President William McKinley was shot by an assassin in Buffalo, New York.  At that time, the Secret Service was assigned to protect the president, in addition to its other duties, and it has carried out that assignment, often not in a secretive fashion, to this day."

    "paragraph": "Eugene O'Neill is regarded as one of the best, if not the best, of America's dramatists.  He was noted and well regarded during his life; however, it was after his demise that his works took their position of preeminence in the theater.|O'Neill experimented with various theatrical techniques before settling on the realistic style for which he received the most recognition.  In his earlier works, he incorporated such devices as transporting Greek myths into modern settings, having characters wear masks to show their feelings and emotions, and allowing the audience to hear characters' inner voices in addition to their actual conversations.|But it is generally for the realistic and often semi-autobiographical plays written later in his life that O'Neill is most renowned. {The Iceman Cometh {depicts the Greenwich Village milieu of friends and acquaintances, with their unrealistic and unrealized aspirations. { A Long Day's Journey into Night{ is a clearly autobiographical depiction of O'Neill's own family life.  {A Moon for the Misbegotten{ presents the final days of O'Neill's alcoholic brother.|Eugene O'Neill did not go unrecognized during his lifetime; the genius of his work was, in fact, well recognized.  In 1936, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and over the years he received Pulitzer Prizes for four of his plays.|However, he did die largely forgotten.  Much of his best work, initially not considered commercially viable, achieved considerable prominence after his death.  {The Iceman Cometh,{ which was written in 1939, was revived in 1956, three years after O'Neill's passing.  The unanticipated success of {The Iceman Cometh{ led to the premiere of {A Long Day's Journey into Night.{  Considered by many to be O'Neill's masterpiece, {A Long Day's Journey into Night{ had actually been finished by the playwright in 1941, 12 years before his death, but it never graced the stage during his lifetime."

    "paragraph": "The question of lunar formation has long puzzled astronomers.  It was once theorized that the moon formed alongside the earth as material in a swirling disk coalesced to form both bodies.  However, if both bodies formed simultaneously out of the same substance, we would expect the mean densities to be more or less identical.  In fact, this is not the case at all.  One of the most curious characteristics of the moon is that it is far less dense than the earth.  Compared to the earth's mean density, which is 5.5 times that of water, the density of the moon is a mere 3.3 times that of water.  Most of the earth's mass is located in its dense iron core, while the mantle and crust are composed primarily of lighter silicates.  The moon, on the other hand, is composed entirely of lighter substances.|An alternate explanation, the \"capture theory,\" suggested that  the moon formed far away and was later captured by the earth.  The moon was once wandering in space, like an asteroid, unattached to a planet.  The rogue satellite veered too close to the earth and has since been tethered by the earth's gravitational field.  However, comparison of lunar and terrestrial isotopes has undermined this theory.  Isotopes are atomic indicators that leave a sort of geological fingerprint.  The isotopes from lunar rock samples indicate that both earth and moon came from the same source.|A more recent theory, the \"impact theory\" of lunar formation postulates that a large planet-like object, perhaps twice the mass of Mars, struck the earth at a shallow angle.  The object disintegrated a portion of the earth's crust and mantle, sending a cloud of silicate vapor into orbit around the earth.  In time, most of the material fell back to earth, while the rest coalesced into our moon.|Computer simulations (1997) by Robin Canup and Glen Stewart of the University of Colorado and by Shigeru Ida of the Tokyo Institute of Technology demonstrated that such a scenario is at least theoretically possible.  While the impact theory is attractive in that it explains both why the moon is less dense than the earth and how both bodies could have originated from the same source, it is not without problems. Impact from a Mars-sized body would produce an earth-moon system with twice as much angular momentum as that which is actually observed.  Therefore, although we are closer to resolving the question of lunar formation, the origin of the moon is still shrouded in mystery."
