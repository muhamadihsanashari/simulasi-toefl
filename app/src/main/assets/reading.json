    "paragraph": "An octopus is a sea creature quite capable of inspiring fear in an unsuspecting swimmer or diver unlucky enough to paddle across one unexpectedly.  There is a basis for a healthy fear of an octopus.  An octopus is quite strong, in large part due to the suckers on its arms.  A common octopus has 240 suckers per arm for a whopping total of 1,920 suckers on all of its arms.  Were an octopus to hold onto an object (or a person, for that matter) with all eight of its arms, a quarter of a ton of force would be needed to loosen its grip.  Another reason wariness for an octopus is not unwarranted is that some types of octopuses are poisonous.  A bite from a venomous type of octopus will undoubtedly cause a stinging pain and may, if left unattended, lead to death within a few hours.|While maintaining a healthy distance from an octopus may be a reasonable position, it is also quite arguable that an octopus poses little threat to humans.  An octopus is shy and timid by nature, much more comfortable hiding out in undersea nooks and crannies or burrowing into the sandy bottom than in seeking out conflict.  An octopus only strikes out when it feels threatened, when an unexpected invader enters its undersea lair or a potential attacker gets too close.  In this situation, an octopus may attack by biting or wrapping its arms around the threatening force.|An octopus, in reality, is much more concerned with avoidance than attack and has a couple of specialized methods of getting away from potential attackers.  One method is to eject forceful jets of water.  These high-powered streams of water allow an octopus to make a high-speed exit from a dangerous location.  Another technique that the octopus uses when eluding a danger is to eject a volume of dark-colored ink.

    "paragraph": "Today, the Secret Service is the agency of the United States government that is charged with the protection of the president and family members of the president.  Any time that the president appears in public, neatly dressed Secret Service agents are clearly in evidence alongside the president.  Secret Service agents might also accompany a presidential spouse to a committee meeting, on a shopping trip, to a charity event, or out for a walk in the park.  Agents accompany the president's children to school on a daily basis, sitting unobtrusively but hardly unnoticed in the background throughout each hour of class, and tag along with the president's children on dates and to any type of social event.|If the Secret Service is so much in evidence around the president and members of the president's family, one might question why the activities of these agents are considered secret.  The name of the agency, however, is not derived from its duty in protecting the president but from its original covert duty in protecting the economy of the young United States from counterfeiters.  Before the Civil War, the official currency of the United States was in coins; however, after the war, the government began issuing paper money.  This new paper currency was easy for counterfeiters to replicate, and soon counterfeit bills flooded the country.

    "paragraph": "The apple, a juicy fruit that grows from pink or white flowers, is cultivated widely in orchards across North America.  At least two varieties of apples are cultivated together in one orchard due to the fact that the flowers of one type of apple tree must be pollinated by a different variety of apple.  The point in the springtime when the apple blossoms appear is the most critical time for apples: there have to be enough bees to pollinate each flower and warm enough weather to facilitate their work.  Apple growers watch the temperatures anxiously at this time of year because frozen flowers or fruit spells disaster for the crop.  Workers may have to get up at any hour of the night to blow away the cold air with fans, heat the orchard air with fire pots, or wet the trees down to keep the frost away.|The first step in getting apples from orchard to market is to pick them.  The picking must be done carefully to ensure that the spur, which produces the fruit, is not damaged.  Apples used to be collected in bushel baskets and taken to market, but today bins of apples are trucked to packing houses, where they go through many sortings before they get to the grocery store display.  As a first step, the smallest apples, called \"chops,\" are eliminated to make juice.  Apples with many flaws, or imperfections, are called \"processors\"; they are used for pie slices or are made into sauce because of their less-than-perfect appearance.  The \"fancy\" grade apples are stored in a controlled atmosphere; adjusting the oxygen content from 20 percent to 2 percent and keeping the temperature between 31 and 32 degrees Fahrenheit keeps the apples alive but prevents overripening.  The humidity is kept around 95 percent so that the apples remain crisp and fresh.  Before shipping, the apples are washed, rinsed, dried, and coated with a thin film of hot wax for beautification.|Once the apples have cleared the marketplace, they are put to various uses.  Apples are 87 percent water, making them great for juicing.  The fresh juice that is made from apples is called cider, and this cider can be fermented into applejack.  Apples are not only used to make beverages; they can also be used to make products such as apple butter, vinegar, applesauce, and one of America's favorite desserts, apple pie.",

    "paragraph": "Today, the Secret Service is the agency of the United States government that is charged with the protection of the president and family members of the president.  Any time that the president appears in public, neatly dressed Secret Service agents are clearly in evidence alongside the president.  Secret Service agents might also accompany a presidential spouse to a committee meeting, on a shopping trip, to a charity event, or out for a walk in the park.  Agents accompany the president's children to school on a daily basis, sitting unobtrusively but hardly unnoticed in the background throughout each hour of class, and tag along with the president's children on dates and to any type of social event.|If the Secret Service is so much in evidence around the president and members of the president's family, one might question why the activities of these agents are considered secret.  The name of the agency, however, is not derived from its duty in protecting the president but from its original covert duty in protecting the economy of the young United States from counterfeiters.  Before the Civil War, the official currency of the United States was in coins; however, after the war, the government began issuing paper money.  This new paper currency was easy for counterfeiters to replicate, and soon counterfeit bills flooded the country.  Secret Service agents, as part of the Department of the Treasury, posed as criminals interested in purchasing large sums of counterfeit bills in order to gather evidence against counterfeiters and put them out of their illegal  business.  For quite some time, the government preferred to keep the public in the dark about the extent of the counterfeiting at that time, afraid that the public would lose confidence in the country's paper money if they knew that there was so much counterfeit money mixed in with the real thing.|It was not until 1901 that the role of the Secret Service was expanded from protecting the currency of the country to protecting its president.  In that year, then President William McKinley was shot by an assassin in Buffalo, New York.  At that time, the Secret Service was assigned to protect the president, in addition to its other duties, and it has carried out that assignment, often not in a secretive fashion, to this day.",

The point in the springtime when the apple blossoms appear is the most critical time for apples: there have to be enough bees to pollinate each flower and warm enough weather to facilitate their work.  Apple growers watch the temperatures anxiously at this time of year because frozen flowers or fruit spells disaster for the crop.

The picking must be done carefully to ensure that the spur, which produces the fruit, is not damaged.  Apples used to be collected in bushel baskets and taken to market, but today bins of apples are trucked to packing houses, where they go through many sortings before they get to the grocery store display.  As a first step, the smallest apples, called \"chops,\" are eliminated to make juice.

Before shipping, the apples are washed, rinsed, dried, and coated with a thin film of hot wax for beautification.|Once the apples have cleared the marketplace, they are put to various uses.

    "paragraph": "The apple, a juicy fruit that grows from pink or white flowers, is cultivated widely in orchards across North America.  At least two varieties of apples are cultivated together in one orchard due to the fact that the flowers of one type of apple tree must be pollinated by a different variety of apple.  The point in the springtime when the apple blossoms appear is the most critical time for apples: there have to be enough bees to pollinate each flower and warm enough weather to facilitate their work.  Apple growers watch the temperatures anxiously at this time of year because frozen flowers or fruit spells disaster for the crop.  Workers may have to get up at any hour of the night to blow away the cold air with fans, heat the orchard air with fire pots, or wet the trees down to keep the frost away.|The first step in getting apples from orchard to market is to pick them.  The picking must be done carefully to ensure that the spur, which produces the fruit, is not damaged.  Apples used to be collected in bushel baskets and taken to market, but today bins of apples are trucked to packing houses, where they go through many sortings before they get to the grocery store display.  As a first step, the smallest apples, called \"chops,\" are eliminated to make juice.  Apples with many flaws, or imperfections, are called \"processors\"; they are used for pie slices or are made into sauce because of their less-than-perfect appearance.  The \"fancy\" grade apples are stored in a controlled atmosphere; adjusting the oxygen content from 20 percent to 2 percent and keeping the temperature between 31 and 32 degrees Fahrenheit keeps the apples alive but prevents overripening.  The humidity is kept around 95 percent so that the apples remain crisp and fresh.  Before shipping, the apples are washed, rinsed, dried, and coated with a thin film of hot wax for beautification.|Once the apples have cleared the marketplace, they are put to various uses.  Apples are 87 percent water, making them great for juicing.  The fresh juice that is made from apples is called cider, and this cider can be fermented into applejack.  Apples are not only used to make beverages; they can also be used to make products such as apple butter, vinegar, applesauce, and one of America's favorite desserts, apple pie.",

    "paragraph": "An octopus is a sea creature quite capable of inspiring fear in an unsuspecting swimmer or diver unlucky enough to paddle across one unexpectedly.  There is a basis for a healthy fear of an octopus.  An octopus is quite strong, in large part due to the suckers on its arms.  A common octopus has 240 suckers per arm for a whopping total of 1,920 suckers on all of its arms.  Were an octopus to hold onto an object (or a person, for that matter) with all eight of its arms, a quarter of a ton of force would be needed to loosen its grip.  Another reason wariness for an octopus is not unwarranted is that some types of octopuses are poisonous.  A bite from a venomous type of octopus will undoubtedly cause a stinging pain and may, if left unattended, lead to death within a few hours.|While maintaining a healthy distance from an octopus may be a reasonable position, it is also quite arguable that an octopus poses little threat to humans.  An octopus is shy and timid by nature, much more comfortable hiding out in undersea nooks and crannies or burrowing into the sandy bottom than in seeking out conflict.  An octopus only strikes out when it feels threatened, when an unexpected invader enters its undersea lair or a potential attacker gets too close.  In this situation, an octopus may attack by biting or wrapping its arms around the threatening force.|An octopus, in reality, is much more concerned with avoidance than attack and has a couple of specialized methods of getting away from potential attackers.  One method is to eject forceful jets of water.  These high-powered streams of water allow an octopus to make a high-speed exit from a dangerous location.  Another technique that the octopus uses when eluding a danger is to eject a volume of dark-colored ink.  The ink temporarily clouds the water and confuses the sense of smell of the attacker while the octopus quickly flees.",

He took great pleasure in creating new and unusual mixtures of drinks for customers at the fountain.|Like many other entrepreneurs of the era, Doc Bradham wanted to create a cola drink to rival Coca-Cola.  By 1895, Coca-Cola was a commercial success throughout the United States, and numerous innovators were trying to come up with their own products to cash in on the success that Coca-Cola was beginning to experience.  In his pharmacy, Doc Bradham developed his own version of a cola drink, and Doc's drink became quite popular at his soda fountain.

    "paragraph": "Susan B. Anthony, teacher by trade and lifelong champion of women's rights, participated throughout her adulthood in the effort to improve the status of women in the United States and to gain rights for them.  She was a stalwart champion of economic independence for women, recognizing the importance of financial independence to the emancipation of women.|She worked tirelessly from 1854 to 1860 in the fight to obtain rights for married women in the state of New York.  She spoke out on the issues, organized volunteers, and circulated petitions asking that married women be granted the rights to own property, to earn wages, to have custody of their children in the event of divorce, and to vote.  In 1860, the landmark Married Women's Property Act, which conferred all of the above rights except the right to vote, was passed in the state of New York.  It became law in large part due to the efforts of Anthony.|In the years following the Civil War, Anthony dedicated her life to obtaining the right to vote for women.  She believed that the right to vote should be a federal right and should not be left up to the discretionary authority of each individual state.  Throughout the rest of her career, she worked on the national level toward the accomplishment of this goal.|Unfortunately, Anthony did not live to see her dream accomplished.  In 1900, at the age of 80, she retired from the presidency of the National American Woman Suffrage Association without having fulfilled her goal of achieving the vote for women but with the undertaking well underway.|When the vote was finally granted to women in the United States in 1920, Anthony was given credit as a primary contributor in the accomplishment of this monumental change in social structure.  In recognition of Anthony's accomplishments, the United States government issued a one-dollar coin in her honor in 1979.  The front side of the coin contained a side view of Anthony's face and was inscribed across the top with the word \"liberty.\"",
